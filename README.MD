# RideWise

Modern navigation apps are extremely effective for cars, but are missing the adaptability necessary for bicycling. In this work, I have attempted to address these shortcomings by incorporating a Large Language Model (LLM) into the standard navigation app structure. This element allows users to request custom modifications in a free-form and easy-to-use format.
